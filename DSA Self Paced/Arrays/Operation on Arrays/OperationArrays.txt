Recap of Operation on Arrays!!

Insert: O(n)
Search: O(n) for Unsorted
        O(log n) for Sorted (Binary Search)
Delete: O(n)

These are speciality of the Arrays - Random Access(arr[i])
Get ith Element: O(1)
Update ith Element: O(1)

Note: Insert at the end (assuming you have extra space in the array) and Delete from the end can be done in O(1) time.


Other data stuctures provide insert, search, delete in much faster time complexity. Especially Hash that has the time complexity for insert, search, delete in O(1) in average.

But arrays, they have the speciality of random access and they also have cache friendliness, which make them useful in many places.
