/*
Given the first 2 terms A and B of a Geometric Series. The task is to find the Nth term of the series.

Example 1:

Input:
A = 2 
B = 3
N = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: The first term is already
given in the input as 2
Example 2:

Input:
A = 1
B = 2
N = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: Common ratio = 2,
Hence second term is 2.
Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function termOfGP() that takes A, B and N as parameter and returns Nth term of GP. The return value should be double that would be automatically converted to floor by the driver code.

Expected Time Complexity : O(logN)
Expected Auxilliary Space : O(1)

Constraints:
-100 <= A <= 100
-100 <= B <= 100
1 <= N <= 5
